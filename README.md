### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_z-index.php) - This helped me for learning 'z-index' properity. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18799207/display-icons-and-text-on-the-same-line) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to align icons with texts. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
